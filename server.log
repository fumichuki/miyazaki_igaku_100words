  "model_answer": "Two positive events in my life were moving to a new town and joining a basketball team.\n\nMoving was important because I met new friends and learned to be more independent. For example, I became more responsible by managing my own time and tasks. This made me more confident. Many students find that moving to a new place gives them a chance to explore different cultures and traditions. This helps them develop a broader perspective on life.\n\nJoining the team was also important because it improved my health and taught me teamwork. For instance, practicing regularly made me stronger, and working with others to win games taught me how to cooperate. Playing sports also provided a sense of belonging and achievement, which boosted my self-esteem.\n\nTherefore, these events helped me grow as a person and enjoy life more.\n\n私の人生における2つのポジティブな出来事は、新しい町に引っ越したこととバスケットボールチームに参加したことです。\n\n引っ越しは、新しい友達に出会い、自立心を学ぶ上で重要でした。例えば、自分の時間やタスクを管理することで、より責任感が強くなりました。これにより自信がつきました。多くの学生は、新しい場所に移ることで、異なる文化や伝統を探求する機会を得ると感じています。これが、人生に対するより広い視野を養う手助けをします。\n\nチームに参加することもまた、健康が改善され、チームワークを学ぶという点で重要でした。例えば、定期的に練習することで体力がつき、試合で勝つために他の人と協力することで協調性を学びました。スポーツをすることは、帰属意識や達成感も提供し、自己評価を高めました。\n\nしたがって、これらの出来事は、私が人として成長し、人生をより楽しむのに役立ちました。",

For example, setting aside two hours each evening for focused study can significantly enhance understanding and retention. This routine helps build strong academic foundations necessary for entrance exams.\n（第一に、学生は詳細な学習計画を作成するべきです。この計画には、過去の教材を復習し、問題解決スキルを練習するための日々のスケジュールを含めるべきです。例えば、毎晩2時間を集中的な学習に充てることで、理解力と記憶力を大幅に向上させることができます。このルーチンは入試に必要な強固な学問的基盤を築くのに役立ちます。）\n\nSecond, engaging in extracurricular activities is crucial. Joining clubs or volunteer groups helps develop communication and leadership skills. For instance, participating in a debate club can improve public speaking and critical thinking. These experiences make students more confident and adaptable, which are valuable traits for university life.\n（第二に、課外活動に参加することが重要です。クラブやボランティアグループへの参加は、コミュニケーションとリーダーシップスキルを向上させます。例えば、ディベートクラブに参加することで、スピーチ能力と批判的思考を向上させることができます。これらの経験は学生をより自信と適応力のある存在にし、大学生活にとって貴重な特性となります。）\n\nTherefore, by following these steps, students can effectively prepare for university admission and future challenges.\n（したがって、これらのステップを踏むことで、学生は大学入学と将来の課題に効果的に備えることができます。）",

  "model_answer": "If an earthquake happens, the first thing I should do is take cover under a table.\n(地震が起きたら、まず机の下に隠れるべきです。)\n\nFirst, staying under a sturdy table protects me from falling objects. For instance, during earthquakes, many people are injured because items like books or lights fall. By protecting my head, I can avoid these injuries.\n(第一に、丈夫な机の下にいることで、落下物から身を守ることができます。例えば、地震中に本や照明が落ちてきて、多くの人が怪我をします。頭を守ることで、これらの怪我を避けられます。)\n\nSecond, staying indoors reduces the risk of accidents. If I run outside too quickly, I might trip or get hit by debris. Staying inside until the shaking stops is safer.\n(第二に、屋内にいることで事故のリスクを減らせます。外に急いで走ると、つまずいたり、瓦礫に当たったりするかもしれません。揺れが止まるまで中にいる方が安全です。)\n\nTherefore, taking cover and waiting until the shaking ends is crucial for safety during an earthquake.\n(したがって、身を隠して揺れが終わるまで待つことは、地震時の安全に不可欠です。)",

  "model_answer": "I believe money is directly related to happiness for two reasons.\n（お金は幸福に直接関係していると考えます。理由は2つあります。）\n\nFirst, money allows people to meet basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare. For instance, having a stable income ensures that a person can afford nutritious meals and necessary medical treatment. When these needs are fulfilled, individuals feel more secure and less stressed.\n（まず、お金があれば食べ物、住居、医療などの基本的なニーズを満たすことができます。例えば、安定した収入があれば、栄養のある食事や必要な医療を受けることができます。これらのニーズが満たされると、安心感が増し、ストレスが軽減されます。）\n\nSecond, money provides more opportunities for personal growth and enjoyment. People can travel, learn new skills, or engage in hobbies. For example, taking a vacation can reduce stress and increase happiness. These experiences contribute to a more fulfilling life.\n（第二に、お金は個人の成長と楽しみのためのより多くの機会を提供します。人々は旅行をしたり、新しいスキルを学んだり、趣味に没頭したりすることができます。例えば、休暇を取ることはストレスを減らし、幸福感を高めることができます。これらの経験はより充実した生活に寄与します。）\n\nTherefore, I think having a reasonable amount of money can significantly enhance one's quality of life.\n（したがって、適度なお金を持つことは生活の質を大幅に向上させると考えます。）",

Additionally, regularly checking the refrigerator prevents food from being forgotten and thrown away.\n（第一に、食事を注意深く計画することは廃棄を減らす良い方法です。家族は買い物の前にリストを作るべきです。これにより、購入し過ぎを避け、食べ物がゴミになるのを防ぎます。さらに、冷蔵庫を定期的にチェックすることで、食品が忘れられて捨てられるのを防ぎます。）\n\nSecond, using leftovers creatively can be very effective. Leftover food can be transformed into new dishes, like making soup from old vegetables. Restaurants and homes can also donate surplus food to charities, helping those in need and reducing waste.\n（第二に、残り物を創造的に使うことは非常に効果的です。余った食材は、古い野菜を使ったスープのように新しい料理に変えられます。また、レストランや家庭では余剰食品を慈善団体に寄付することで、困っている人々を助け、廃棄を減らすことができます。）\n\nTherefore, everyone should try to reduce food waste for a sustainable future.\n（したがって、持続可能な未来のために、すべての人が食品廃棄を減らす努力をすべきです。）",
